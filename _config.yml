          Computer engineering involves different aspects of technology, one of the most noticeable being circuitry and the understanding of electrical engineering principles and their applications. 
          Another important facet is the computer side of engineering, the programming and interworking's behind technology. 
          Every course has been instrumental in the broadening of my understanding of computer engineering, and led to the further interest of where technology will go next.
